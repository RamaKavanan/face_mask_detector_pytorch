# face_mask_detector_pytorch
**Objective**
Face mask detector used to identify the person on image/video stream wearing face mask with the help of computer vision and deep learning algorithm by using the PyTorch library.

**Overview**
The face mask detector developed use the CNN MobileNetV2 architecture. We used the OpenCV for computer vision operations and the PyTorch used to develop the CNN models.
